# Music Mood Recommender
Recommends music based on user activity / mood using K Means clustering.

**Overview:**
This project aims to recommend music based on user input about their current activity or mood. It utilizes K Means clustering on a Spotify music dataset to categorize songs into 10 different mood clusters. The system predicts the user's mood and suggests top music tracks closely aligned with that mood cluster.

**Features:**
1. **Input Prompt:** Users enter their current activity or mood.
2. **Mood Prediction:** Predicts one of 10 possible moods based on user input.
3. **Music Classification:** Utilizes K Means clustering to classify Spotify music into 10 distinct mood clusters.
4. **Recommendation System:** Matches the predicted mood cluster with its centroid and recommends top 5 music tracks closest to the centroid by default.

**Usage:**
- Enter your current activity or mood.
- Receive a prediction of your mood.
- Explore music recommendations tailored to your predicted mood.

**Technologies Used:**
Python, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook, Claude 3
